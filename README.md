Computational-Economics
=======================

Code for a computational economics course I am teaching at the University of 
Edinburgh.  This year's curriculum consisted of...

1. The Solow Model: discrete time version of the [Robert Solow's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Solow) 
classic 1956 article [A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth](http://faculty.lebow.drexel.edu/LainczC/cal38/Growth/Solow_1956.pdf).  
2. The Ramsey Model: discrete time version of [Frank Ramsey's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_P._Ramsey) classic 1928 article
[A Mathematical Theory of Saving](folk.uio.no/gasheim/zRam1928.pdf).
