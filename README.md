Computational-Economics
=======================

Code for a computational economics course I am teaching at the University of 
Edinburgh.  This year's curriculum consists of...

The Solow Model:
--------------- 
A discrete time version of [Robert Solow's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Solow) 
classic 1956 article entitled: [A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth](http://faculty.lebow.drexel.edu/LainczC/cal38/Growth/Solow_1956.pdf).  In this lab students...

* Explore some of the basic implications of the Cobb-Douglas production function using 3D graphics and contour plots.
* Learn to write basic Python functions to code the key equations of the Solow model.
* Solve for the steady state of the Solow model analytically and numerically.
* Learn the basics of symbolic and numerical differentiation in order to assess the stability properties of the model's steady state.
* Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and simulation using the Python class **solowModel**.
* Analyze the response of the model to shocks to the key exogenous parameter model, the savings rate. 

The Ramsey Model: 
-----------------
A discrete time version of [Frank Ramsey's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_P._Ramsey) classic 1928 article entitled:
[A Mathematical Theory of Saving](folk.uio.no/gasheim/zRam1928.pdf). In this lab students...

* Explore some of the basic implications for inter-temporal optimization of the CRRA utility function using 3D graphics and contour plots.
* Learn to write basic Python functions to code the key equations of the Ramsey model.
* Solve for the steady state of the Ramsey model analytically and numerically.
* More basics of symbolic and numerical differentiation in order to assess the stability properties of the model's steady state. Need to calculate the Jacobian and its eigenvalues/vectors!
* More Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and simulation using the Python class **ramseyModel**.
* Solve for a linear approximation to the optimal policy function for consumption.
* Solve for the full non-linear optimal policy function for consumption using the forward-shooting algorithm.
* Compare the linear approximation with the full non-linear optimal policy to discover how good the linear approximation actually is!
* Some basic welfare analysis of the Ramsey model.
* Finally, we consider the response of a Ramsey economy to a shock to the growth rate of technology.
